# Last Lamp: Plan

**When asked "what's next?", the answer is the first open item under NEXT UP** (order set by the owner).
**To continue in a new chat:** "Read PLAN.md and start the NEXT UP task."

Unity 6000.0.85f1, Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

## NEXT UP (in order)

Nothing yet. The owner sets the first task.

## Rules

### Building things
- **Build things in the scene hierarchy, not in code.** Menus, buildings, vehicles, anything visible are real objects in the scene or a prefab, so the owner can edit them. Scripts hold references and run the behaviour.
- The usual way: a one-off Tools menu script that builds the objects, then is deleted (kept in git history).
- Plain positioned UI, no layout groups unless asked.
- **Every button is a copy of one shared UI button prefab.** Change only the name, place, size and text on a copy; restyle in the prefab. The prefab doesn't exist yet; make it when the first button is needed.

### Working in this project
- Each bug fix gets its own commit, so the history shows it as a fix.

### Releasing
- Change only Project Settings > Player > Version. The Android version code is set from it on every Android build. This needs `Assets/Editor/AndroidVersionCode.cs` from Farming-Simulator-94, which is not in this project yet.
